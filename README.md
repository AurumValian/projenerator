## Abstract

Have you ever needed a project but couldn't decide the topic? Try out The Project Project! The Project Project takes a list of public APIs and a list of random audiences, then provides you with a random API/audience pair. The possibilities are vast, and the options stretch creativity! Like one? Save it to your favorites!

This was a 5-day project to create a React app with an external API.

## Installation
